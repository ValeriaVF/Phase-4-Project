## Business Issue
Understanding brand and product reputation is difficult when only provided customer survey and review data. There is an abundence of social media responses to products and brands on various platforms.

## Data & Methods
The dataset comes from Crowdflower via [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). The data contains over 9,000 tweets from twitter users on how they evaluated multiple brands and products. The crowd was asked if the tweet expressed positive, negative, or no emotion towards a brand and/or product. If some emotion was expressed they were also asked to say which brand or product was the target of that emotion.
